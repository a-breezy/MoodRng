## Description

MoodRng is a web app that allows users to track mood over time. Users log their mood, amount of sleep, recent meals, and activities. Their data is then graphed using a mood-scale of 1-6 over time. Their graphed data allows users to see what's brought their mood up and what's brought it down, because we all want a happier life.
